Some of the products prsmusa.com offers are the following:

scout is a software that runs on client machines and checks in with a server to let it know its still alive. when this client detects that it has lost a network connection, it will run diagnostics to see if things where the problem is. it will then write a file that includes tests like ping, mtr, dns checks and create a report that will be uploaded to the server when network connection is available again.
the server at the same time will detect when it doesnt receive a signal from the client anymore. it will let the customer know that they have lost internal network connection and will also let them know when service has returned. the server should also run diagnostics to the failing clients last known IP. This report will be sent to the customer immediately. THe client report will be appended to the same report when it is able to upload the report when network connection is restored.

This project implements a scalable, multi-location virtual queue management system using FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL. The system allows customers to enter queues via QR codes, receive status updates, and enables admins to manage queues through a centralized Admin Portal. Each business location has its own segregated queue. Here is an example:
The manager of starbucks in kokomo indiana has a QR code displayed. when a customer scans the QR code, that user is entered into a queue for that location. the customer will receive a text message with a url where they can track what their place in line is. THe customer will also get a text when they are 3rd in line. The manager of the kokomo starbucks will have access to a staff page (portal) where they can manange customer queues. The admin for starbucks can see all customer queues.
